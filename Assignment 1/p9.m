function W = p9(X_train, Y_train, iterNum, wInit, alpha)
% Function p8 performs the training to get better weight with softmax single sample rule for multiclass(m) classification problem 
% Inputs    X_train - an input training samples size n*d
%           Y_train - their true class size n*1
%           iterNum - the number of iterations
%           wInit - initial weight for liner classifier (m*(d+1))
%           alpah - fixed learning rate
% Outputs   w - best weights w (size(d + 1) Ã— 1) you find
